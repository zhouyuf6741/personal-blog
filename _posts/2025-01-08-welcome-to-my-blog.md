Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my personal blog. I'm Yufeng, a builder working at a stealth startup in the SF Bay Area. This is where I'll be sharing my thoughts, experiences, and discoveries as I navigate the world of technology, entrepreneurship, and life.

## What You Can Expect

I plan to write about:

- **Technology & Development**: Insights from my work in tech
- **Startup Life**: The ups and downs of working at an early-stage company
- **Building Things**: Projects I'm working on and lessons learned
- **Random Thoughts**: Whatever's on my mind that might be interesting

## Why a Blog?

In our fast-paced world, I believe there's value in taking time to reflect and share experiences. This blog serves as both a personal journal and a way to connect with others who might find these thoughts useful.

Feel free to reach out if anything I write resonates with you or if you'd like to discuss any topics further!

Thanks for stopping by! ðŸš€
